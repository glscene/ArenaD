7of9_README.txt			15:44 03DEC99

This model is based on "7of9", from Star Trek: Voyager. Though I intend to release several female 
models for Half-Life, "7" has sat around waiting for the others. I just feel it's her time. "7" is specifically designed to be 'skinner friendly' (SkF). What I mean is anyone who wants to repaint the skin should be able to look at it, and tell exactly what's what. Thus, 'SkF'. If you do a nice repaint please feel free to send it to me at:

mann_slaughter@usa.net

I think a nice skin of Marvel Comics' "Black Widow" would kick ass! 

Come and see what other models I've made at:

This model has NO team color capability. If the colors in the preview pic change, don't worry. They WON'T change in-game.
