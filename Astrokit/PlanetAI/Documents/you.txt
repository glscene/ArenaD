I was hitting on girls all night,
but you...
you
you came to me.
You asked me how I was
and you wanted to know
and I told you;
I said:

"You."

"You are beautiful."

I don't know your number
but 
we danced all night
in a sea of people.
I remember
Your smooth face
Your amazing eyes
Your long blonde hair.
When I said you were cute
you smiled
and laughed
and said "No you are cute"
I kissed you
and you kissed me back
my hands ran through your soft hair
all night
but
Your friends took you away,
I ran outside to find you
I shouted out your name
But I was too late.
Where are you?

I want you back
