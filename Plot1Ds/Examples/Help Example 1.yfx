When the application is opened for the first time it should appear	128
as shown here, except that the text will not appear but a grid will be shown.	128
To the right there should be two windows, the top window contains	128
a field with the label 'y = f(x)'. Below this is a list of functions.	128
This list cannot be empty, however it can contain a blank entry as it	128
does now.	128
If a function is entered the graph for that function will be displayed	128
as well as a label containing that function.	128
	128
As an example try entering x in the function field.	128
	128
There are other fields which can be altered to change the way the	128
graph is displayed.	128
The increment field can be altered either by entering a number or	128
by using the up down buttons to the right of the field.	128
If that number is not an integer or is less than 1 an integer number	128
will be used.	128
A very large increment will produce a graph that is less accurate. 	128
	128
There are two fields associated with the 'Label (x, y)' label.	128
This is the position of the function's label displayed on the graph.	128
	128
	128
The position of the function's label can be altered either by entering	128
different coordinates such as 2 and 6 or by dragging the label to a	128
new location using the left button of the mouse. 	128
{Try it to see how the label is relocated}	128
The function label need not appear on the graph, just click on	128
the 'Show function label' check box.	128
The function itself will only be displayed if the	128
check box next to the function is checked.	128
The appearance of the graph can be altered by	128
altering the 'Plot Pen Width' and 'Pen colour'.	128
The other fields in this window will be	128
explained later.	128

Now look at the lower right window.	32768
The plot range is displayed in the first four fields.	32768
If the 'Save' button is pressed these values will be saved so that	32768
you can return to the current plot range if the plot range is altered.	32768
The plot range can be altered either by entering values in these fields	32768
or by using the mouse.	32768
Just use left button of the mouse to drag the graph to a new position.	32768
If the 'Ctrl' button is held down while dragging the axes will be altered	32768
differently depending on which way the mouse is dragged, left or right or	32768
up or down.	32768
Use the mouse wheel or the '+' / '-' keys of the numeric key pad to zoom	32768
in or out	32768
The 'up' 'down' 'left' and 'right' keys of the numeric key pad can be used	32768
as well.	32768
{Try it to see the effect.}	32768
